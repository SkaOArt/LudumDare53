mc: „Hey, I'm in a hurry. Just a moment." #id:19
mc: I'm on the phone with my best friend. We wanted to go for a walk in the city today and talk a bit.
mc: As I leave the apartment complex, I hear a strange noise. #id:1a
Join best_friend (new) 3
best_friend (new): „I'm sorry, but I can't make it today. I just received a visit from my parents. We will have to postpone it until next time." #id:1b
I bite my lip. This is the third time now that my best friend has canceled. I want to say something...but we're best friends! #id:1c
- But I have to say something! #id:1d
	mc: „Uh, do you know..." #id:1e
	best_friend: „Yes, I'll be right there! What's the matter, {mc}?" #id:1f
	mc: I sigh softly and shake my head. #id:20
	mc: „No, no... all good." #id:21
- I choose to remain silent. #id:22
best_friend: „I'm really sorry, but tomorrow is definitely the day!" #id:23
I hear that she's sorry, but I still hesitate. Tomorrow, I was actually planning to take a break and have some time for myself... #id:24
best_friend: „Alright then, see you tomorrow!" #id:25
mc: „Yes,  tomorrow then. Well, have a good day!" #id:26
I agree hurriedly and after a brief farewell, I feel a bit frustrated. Strange noises don't improve my mood, and I turn in the direction they're coming from. #id:27
mc: „What was that?" #id:28
