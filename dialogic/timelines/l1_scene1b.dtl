mc: After taking a few steps towards the package and examining it more closely, I discover that it's ripped open and contains a gift. After carefully examining the package, I'm able to decipher the address and recipient name.

mc: I pick up the package and set off. I'm sure I can bring some joy to my neighbor. After the breakup with her ex, he seemed to retaliate with childish behavior by not delivering her mail properly.
