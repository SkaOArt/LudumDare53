	I jump as the salesman suddenly walks past me and stands in front of me. In doing so, he trips over the package. After a brief stumble, he regains his balance and starts talking.
	I pick up the package again and notice that the salesman is making sure he is visible.

	I jump as the salesman suddenly walks past me and stands in front of me. He makes sure the package does not cover him too much.

seller (default): „I'm Carson Colinski, your man today. I'm not just any salesman. I'm your friend who wants to offer you only the best of the best.“
I am about to say something, but the salesman is already pointing at a red sports car.
seller (pleased): „That is your car, the latest model that you can pay for in installments. But wait, I can see that's not your thing. But don't worry, I'll find the perfect car for you.“
mc: I open my mouth to say something, but he interrupts me right away.
seller (default): „These days there are so many cars and uncertainties. You clearly belong to the kind of people who want it a little safer. Just follow me..“
I follow him reluctantly, but I don't want to be rude either. This is at least my chance to say something!
mc: „I am actually here because of the package. It's for a Mr. Akuban.“
seller (happy): „Of course, you are a delivery person. Then I have the perfect vehicle for you.“
I sigh quietly and clear my throat. This can't be true! I just want to deliver the package!
seller (pleased): „This is our compact car. Very handy, a bit older, but it has all the tires and has always been serviced in the workshop. Exactly the right car for you. Look at the price. A real bargain!“
I look at the price and hesitate for a moment.
- I think I'll take the car!
	mc: „Then I might as well drive to Mr. Akuban's with it!“
	The salesman suddenly smiles broadly as soon as I agree.
	seller: „Wonderful, then we can conclude the contract right away!“
	Leave seller

	mc: Barely out of the office, I suddenly feel much worse. I now have the address and my own car, but something in me says I will regret it in the next few years. Is it because of the strange fine print?
	mc: Although I now have a car, I can't use it. Apparently, the salesman wants to take the car back to the workshop again, so I will have to walk to the bar.
	VAR {auto} = "true"
- I won't take the car.
	mc: „Thanks, but I'm not interested in the car.“
	seller (default): „Okay, then maybe-"
	mc: „NO!“
	mc: „I'm not interested in the car, but I need to find Mr. Akuban. Can you tell me where he is or do you not know him?"
	The salesman purses his lips and lets out a heavy sigh.
	seller (default): „Are you really not willing to buy a car?“
	mc: „Listen, if this keeps going on like this...!“
	He quickly raises his hands and puts on his brightest smile. In that moment, I feel the overwhelming desire to wipe it off his face.
	seller (happy): „Mr. Akuban is a good friend. He works at the bar which is not very far from here. A good man, that guy. Say hello to him from me. You just go straight from here and take the first right. You can't miss the bar.“
	mc: „Thank you very much.“
	Leave seller
	I said goodbye and felt very relieved to be getting away from this man. Buying a car had suddenly become much less attractive than I had  previously thought.
	VAR {auto} = "false"
