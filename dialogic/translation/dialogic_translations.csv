Text/31/text,"I pick up the package and set off. I'm sure I can bring some joy to my neighbor. After the breakup with her ex, he seemed to retaliate with childish behavior by not delivering her mail properly.",
Text/32/text,"„Hello {mc}, nice to see you. Since when do you deliver packages?“",
Text/33/text,I notice how she glances at the package and is visibly surprised.,
Text/34/text,"As soon as we make brief eye contact, she turns away quickly and looks at the package.",
Text/35/text,„... uhm“,
Text/36/text,"„Hi Miu, the package is for you. It was by the trash can...“",
Text/37/text,I explain slowly and see how she hesitantly approaches. She takes the package and looks at the address before shaking her head and peering inside.,
Text/38/text,"„That's not mine. I think it belongs to Mr. Akuban. He moved away quite some time ago, and there have been mix-ups with our last names before.“",
Text/39/text,"I nod slowly in understanding and have to strain myself to continue listening to her.
She always speaks a little quieter than the others.",

Text/5a/text,I pick up the package again and notice that the salesman is making sure he is visible.,
Text/5b/text,I jump as the salesman suddenly walks past me and stands in front of me. He makes sure the package does not cover him too much.,
Text/5c/text,"„I'm Carson Colinski, your man today. I'm not just any salesman. I'm your friend who wants to offer you only the best of the best.“",
Text/5d/text,"I am about to say something, but the salesman is already pointing at a red sports car.",
Text/5e/text,"„That is your car, the latest model that you can pay for in installments. But wait, I can see that's not your thing. But don't worry, I'll find the perfect car for you.“",
Text/5f/text,"I open my mouth to say something, but he interrupts me right away.",
Text/60/text,„These days there are so many cars and uncertainties. You clearly belong to the kind of people who want it a little safer. Just follow me..“,
Text/61/text,"I follow him reluctantly, but I don't want to be rude either. This is at least my chance to say something!",
Text/62/text,„I am actually here because of the package. It's for a Mr. Akuban.“,
Text/63/text,"„Of course, you are a delivery person. Then I have the perfect vehicle for you.“",
Text/64/text,I sigh quietly and clear my throat. This can't be true! I just want to deliver the package!,
Text/65/text,"„This is our compact car. Very handy, a bit older, but it has all the tires and has always been serviced in the workshop. Exactly the right car for you. Look at the price. A real bargain!“",
Text/66/text,I look at the price and hesitate for a moment.,
Choice/67/text,I think I'll take the car!,
Choice/67/disabled_text,,
Text/68/text,„Then I might as well drive to Mr. Akuban's with it!“,
Text/69/text,The salesman suddenly smiles broadly as soon as I agree.,
Text/6a/text,"„Wonderful, then we can conclude the contract right away!“",
Text/6b/text,"Barely out of the office, I suddenly feel much worse. I now have the address and my own car, but something in me says I will regret it in the next few years. Is it because of the strange fine print?",
Text/6c/text,"Although I now have a car, I can't use it. Apparently, the salesman wants to take the car back to the workshop again, so I will have to walk to the bar.",
Choice/6d/text,I won't take the car.,

Text/6e/text,"„Thanks, but I'm not interested in the car.“",
Text/6f/text,"„Okay, then maybe-""",
Text/70/text,„NO!“,
Text/71/text,"„I'm not interested in the car, but I need to find Mr. Akuban. Can you tell me where he is or do you not know him?""",
Text/72/text,The salesman purses his lips and lets out a heavy sigh.,
Text/73/text,„Are you really not willing to buy a car?“,
Text/74/text,"„Listen, if this keeps going on like this...!“",
Text/75/text,"He quickly raises his hands and puts on his brightest smile. In that moment, I feel the overwhelming desire to wipe it off his face.",
Text/76/text,"„Mr. Akuban is a good friend. He works at the bar which is not very far from here. A good man, that guy. Say hello to him from me. You just go straight from here and take the first right. You can't miss the bar.“",
Text/77/text,„Thank you very much.“,
Text/78/text,I said goodbye and felt very relieved to be getting away from this man. Buying a car had suddenly become much less attractive than I had  previously thought.,
Text/79/text,„We have not opened yet. Come back later...“,
Text/7a/text,"I decide to approach the bartender and ask for Mr. Akuban. The closer I get to the counter, the more unsure I become.",
Text/7b/text,"„Shut up, Ciper, drink your crap and get lost.“",
Text/7c/text,"The bartender shouts, and I flinch slightly. I sit down at the bar and place the package as close to me as possible.",
Text/7d/text,"„What do you want here, kiddo??“",
Text/7e/text,„I'm looking for a Mr. Akuban... so...“,
Text/7f/text,I am silenced as the bartender looks at me with a cold and downright creepy gaze.,
Text/80/text,"„Get out of here, you have no business here.“",
Text/81/text,I quickly realize that he doesn't want to talk to me. So I have to make sure!,
Text/82/text,"„Get lost.""",
Text/83/text,"„They call me Boris here. Drop the 'Mister' What do you want, kiddo?“",
Text/84/text,"„I'm here because of the package, it's for you...“",
Text/85/text,"I push the package over to him and after inspecting and unpacking it, he looks at me for a while. Finally, he slams his hand on the counter, which completely confuses me.",
Text/86/text,„Damn witch! Wait a minute.“,
Text/87/text,"He says and disappears shortly after. As he comes back, he has a small card and a note with him. The note has an address and directions, while the card is clearly a birthday card.",
Text/88/text,"„That's my niece's birthday gift! I would be very grateful if you could bring it to her. Actually, I didn't want to take the witch's gift, but since you made an effort to earn my respect, I'll turn a blind eye.""",
Text/89/text,"He seems sulky, but continues speaking.",
Text/8a/text,"„My niece's birthday is today... please let her know that I'll come by later. Unfortunately, I have to stay in this place longer today.“",
Text/8b/text,I am surprised by his words and couldn't possibly refuse.,
Text/8c/text,"Boris isn't a bad guy, and since I had already taken the whole way, I might as well go the last few meters.",
Text/8d/text,I pack the gift and the card and say goodbye to Boris.,
Text/8e/text,"As I reach the bar, the smell of alcohol and smoke hit me. There is a man standing behind the counter.",
Text/8f/text,"As I reach the bar, the smell of alcohol and smoke hit me, and I noticed some of the guests staring at me. There is a man standing behind the counter.",
Text/90/text,The bartender seems much friendlier all of a sudden after I made an effort to show him that I am serious.,
Text/91/text,„Thank you. It looks much better now!“,
Text/92/text,"""Hey don't touch my stuff!""",
Text/93/text,Maybe he will talk to me when I help him.,
Text/94/text,"""Hey, can I help you out by sorting the shelf?""",
Text/95/text,"""Fine. If you sort them properly, I might be willing to help you.""",
Text/96/text,"I am actually glad that I don't have to carry the big package anymore, but only the gift and the attached card. That makes things much easier!",
Text/97/text,"Slowly but surely, I approach the address. I hear children's laughter and also a few screams of joy. Children can be very peculiar at times.",
Text/98/text,"After I reach the house, I see how much it's decorated.
Children are running around, but one of the them looks particularly sad and is standing around watching the others.",
Text/99/text,I approach the girl who looks at me questioningly.,
Text/9a/text,„I don't know you.“,
Text/9b/text,„I'm {mc}. I'm here because I have a very important delivery for the birthday girl!“,
Text/9c/text,„I am the birthday girl! I'm Lara and today is my seventh birthday.“,
Text/9d/text,"Proudly, the girl raises her hands to show the number on her fingers. Instantly, she looks at the gift and seems very excited.",
Text/9e/text,"„Your uncle and aunt both wanted me to deliver this to you, and your uncle even sent a card along with it.“",
Text/9f/text,"„As long as he comes, it's not a problem!“",
Text/a0/text,„Is this... the present they got for me?“,
Text/a1/text,I see how the girl keeps looking at the wrapped gift and hand her the package as well as the card.,

Text/a3/text,"The girl hurries to unwrap the present, and a teddy bear comes into view which she hugs tightly.",
Text/a4/text,[wave freq=8.0][font_size=60]„A teddy bear!“[/font_size][/wave],
